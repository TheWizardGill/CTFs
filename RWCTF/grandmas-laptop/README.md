You can upload maximum 8 GiB of raw disk image for each drive.

### Console (aka. VM)

Due to limited hardware capacity, console access is time-limited and provided
upon request. Each team shares a single console.

After click `Request console access` button, you have 15 minutes to play with
it. The VM's state is persisted across power cycles, and purged when 15 minutes
expire.

After click `Power Up` button, there will be a VNC console pop-up. Where you
have access to vga / keyboard / mouse / power-controls.

### Network

A single NIC is always attached to the VM. After VM power-up, the homepage
will show `NIC URL`. A client software, which pumps frames between remote
WebSocket and local TAP interface, is provided in the challenge attachment.

For Linux:

./nic-client-linux-amd64 -persist -url wss://47.88.103.9:1337/nic/XXXXXXXXXXXX
